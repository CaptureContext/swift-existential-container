Initially I was challenged with the idea of creating AnyView from Any by https://github.com/glukianets at the end of 2k22.

It was fun, I successfully passed the challenge, and now I challenge u, my reader, to implement similar thing without use of `_openExistential` (it is possible using tho even more tricky) ðŸ˜Ž
